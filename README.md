# 04_TriangulationFrom2Imgs
## Introduction
This demo provides an example for triangulation. 
## Environment
This demo is created with CLion but it is okay for you to open it with your usual IDE. 
The neccessary libraries can be found in CMakeLists.txt

## Usage
The image pair to be reconstructed are stored in MyPump01, of course you may use your own image pair.
run main.cpp and the reconstructed point cloud will be stored in a file whose name ended by .ply
A MeshLab app would help you with point-cloud-visulization.
